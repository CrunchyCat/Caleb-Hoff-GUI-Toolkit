1) JFrameCH
Looking to make a simple java app? Everyone starts by creating a JFrame. The issue, however, is that these look incredibly dated and ugly without a lot of work. JFrameCH makes things a lot simpler in a few ways. First, just by adding the letters "CH" to the instantiation of a JFrame, you can create a much nicer looking frame very quickly.

It's very simple to use. Just import the Caleb Hoff library and instantiate a JFrame using JFrameCH(). This is the code for the example seen above.
